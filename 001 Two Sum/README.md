# Notes
* Optimal solutionL: one pass hash table. Each time add one element to the table and check if it's complement is in the table, if so we found the answer.
* hashtable `<int, int>`, first element is value of each number, second is the corresponding index.
* Time cpmlexity: _O(n)_; Space complexity: _O(n)_
