# Notes
* use hashtable, to find the element appears most offen, increment the value of the key when visited each time
* sort the vector and the return the n/2th element.
* use stack, insert when value matches previous value, pop when doesn't match 
* Time complexity: _O(n)_, need to visit each number
* Space complexity: _O(k)_ number of different num for hash table, _O(c)_ number of appearance of the majority number in worst case.
