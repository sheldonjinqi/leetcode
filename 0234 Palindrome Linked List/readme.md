# Notes 
* brute force method: convert the linked list to a vector and use two pointer to compare head and end/
* in-place method: find the index of the center element, reverse the second half of the linked list and compare one by one 
* both method has _O(n)_ time complexity, brute force has _O(n)_ space complexity where in-place method has constant space complexity /
